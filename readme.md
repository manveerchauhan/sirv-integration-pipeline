# SIRV Integration Pipeline for Long-Read scRNA-seq

A pipeline for integrating SIRV spike-in reads into existing scRNA-seq datasets to benchmark isoform discovery tools.

![Pipeline Overview](pipeline_overview.png)

## Overview

This pipeline allows you to create semi-synthetic benchmarking datasets by adding SIRV (Spike-In RNA Variant) reads to an existing single-cell RNA-seq dataset. The primary purpose is to evaluate transcript discovery and quantification tools like FLAMES by providing a ground truth of known transcripts at controlled abundances.

Key features:
- Maps SIRV reads to reference to identify their transcript of origin
- Integrates SIRV reads into an existing ONT long-read scRNA-seq dataset
- Adds cell barcodes and UMIs to SIRV reads for single-cell analysis
- Truncates reads to match realistic length distributions
- Provides tracking information for expected vs. observed comparisons

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/manveerchauhan/sirv-integration-pipeline.git
cd sirv-integration-pipeline

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dependencies

Python 3.7+, numpy, pandas, pysam, biopython, matplotlib, jinja2
External: minimap2, samtools

You can install most Python dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install pysam pandas numpy biopython
```

For minimap2 and samtools, follow their installation instructions or use conda:

```bash
conda install -c bioconda minimap2 samtools
```
